				<ul> Hello my world</ul>
				<l1> thank God i am getting it</l1>
				<l2> <b> what is devops?</b> is a software development methodology or 
				         approach that  stresses communication, collaboration and integration 
					 between software devlopers and I.T professionals.
					 It is a response to the interdependency of a software development and I. T
					 operations.</l2>
				<l3> Devops began with the SDLC (software development life cycle) where in Dev where working in 
				     islotation to the tester or QA and not in collaboration with the Ops team.</l3>
				     Now came the agile methodology wherein there was a gap closure between the dev team and the
				     testers but the Ops team where still in isolation</l3>
				 <l4> Finally there was the collaboration of the 3 teams to make up DevOps which means
				      Dev + tester + Ops = DevOps </l4>
				<l5> graphically, Waterfall methodology was Dev , QA/Tester, Ops
				     Agile, Dev + Tester, Ops
				     DevOps, Dev + Tester + Ops Team = DevOps </l5>
				<l6> What are the benefit of Devops? Software developments cycle were fast to impliment,
				     it was flexible, time saving and there was collaboration within the teams involved</l6>
